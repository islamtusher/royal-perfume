                        Props is an object . It stores the value of attributes of a tag. We can pass the data from one component to another component by the Props. When we work with Similar in look different in data component Props come to play in these cases, We pass the different data in different time in the same component by props, we can Destructure the props object and use them easily. Props can be a variable function, object or array.
                        Note that, Props are read-only so we canâ€™t change the value of props

                        State is a React Built in structure. State components can store and modify  their own data but a state should not be modified directly like a js variable, State has a special method setState() and by using this method state should be changed. Based on user action state will be changed and react rendering happens based on state data. 
                        So By State changes the React gets informed and re-renders the DOM with which component has updated the state, and whole process will happens without re-rendering the full DOM
